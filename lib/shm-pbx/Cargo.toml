# We should call these required features, but the goal is to allow pivot to
# some other OS-level integration if we need it. In particular, interacting
# with the file paths and getting a pid might not even need the overheads of a
# (synchronous) syscall if there are other strategies. We might have cached the
# PID, want to do file traversal async, etc.
#
# FIXME: disable these defaults? We want to have a true choice.

# The IO-uring state tracking needs slotmap. We're using tokio for eventing a
