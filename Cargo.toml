# Using the high-level crate instead of `libc` as an abstraction of safe
# patterns. Also I'm hoping to encourage (myself, other authors) to contribute
# towards such stable, idiomatic bindings as its official support list is
# woeful.

[features]
# We should call these required features, but the goal is to allow pivot to
# some other OS-level integration if we need it. In particular, interacting
# with the file paths and getting a pid might not even need the overheads of a
# (synchronous) syscall if there are other strategies. We might have cached the
# PID, want to do file traversal async, etc.
